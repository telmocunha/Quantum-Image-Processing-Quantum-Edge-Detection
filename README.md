# Quantum-Image-Processing-Quantum-Edge-Detection

This project is a simple study on the use of quantum approaches for edge detection and image processing. The objective of this project is to analyze the use of edge detection and image processing using quantum computing, as well as gain a basic understanding of how they operate. This project follows the fundamentals present in Qiskit to perform quantum computing in image processing.

To develop this project, it is implemented using basic quantum circuits methods, such as Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection, FRQI, and NEQR. The Qiskit software framework, a well-Known open-source quantum computing toolkit, is used in this project.
